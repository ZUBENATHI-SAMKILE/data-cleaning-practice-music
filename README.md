## Music Data Cleaning 🎵

- This notebook focuses on learning data cleaning and analysis using a dataset of top songs from 1923–2023.
- I practiced loading Structured data manually with pandas, cleaning the “duration” column, and visualizing song duration trends over time using matplotlib.

- Importing and reading CSV data manually in Jupyter Notebook
- Cleaning and transforming columns (splitting and converting time)
- Finding shortest and longest songs
- Visualizing duration trends by year

# Tools Used.
